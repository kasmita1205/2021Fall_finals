## Title : Global and US Energy Trends
### Objective: 
- To study the changes in energy trends over the years in US and around the globe and  analyzing it with respect to pre pandemic and pandemic situations.
### Data Sources:
1.	COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University- https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/who_covid_19_situation_reports
3.	International - U.S. Energy Information Administration-https://www.eia.gov/international/data/world
4.	OPEC - https://asb.opec.org/data/ASB_Data.php
### Hypothesis:
1.	There is no change in energy consumption in US during pandemic
2.	There is no significant change in crude oil prices during pandemic
3.	The increase in usage of renewable energy in recent years doesn’t affect usage of non renewable energy in US.
4.	With development there is increase in per person electricity consumption in both US and around the globe.
5.	With promotion of renewable energy in recent years, there is drop in CO2 emissions.
### Results:
1.	There is no change in energy consumption in US during pandemic

Based on the above graph we reject our null hypothesis that there is no change in energy consumption in US during pandemic as we can see that there is steep drop in energy consumption during year 2020 as compared to previous years. The overall energy consumption pattern recovered after April 2020 though there is significant change in amount of energy consumption.

2.	There is no significant change in crude oil prices during pandemic

We reject our null hypothesis that there is no significant change in prices of crude oil during pandemic as from above graph we can see that there is remarkable change in prices of crude oil during the pandemic i.e year 2020 as compared to 2019.

3.	The increase in usage of renewable energy in recent years doesn’t affect usage of non renewable energy.
As from the plot we can see that for the past two decades the consumption of renewable energy is rising constantly but till now it has not created any notable impact on usage of non renewable energy. Hence, the null hypothesis is correct.

4.	With development there in increase in per person electricity consumption in both US and around the globe.
Over the years it is observed that per capita energy consumption has increased around the globe but interestingly the negative trend is observed in case of US after year 2008. Hence, the hypothesis is true when considering global energy consumption but it is not true in case of every country.
