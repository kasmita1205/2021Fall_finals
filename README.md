## Title : Global and US Energy Trends
### Objective: 
- To study the changes in energy trends over the years in US and around the globe and  analyzing it with respect to pre pandemic and pandemic situations.
### Data Sources:
1.	COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University- https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/who_covid_19_situation_reports
3.	International - U.S. Energy Information Administration-https://www.eia.gov/international/data/world
4.	OPEC - https://asb.opec.org/data/ASB_Data.php
5. Statistical Review of World Energy – all data, 1965-2020 - 	https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html
### Hypothesis:
1.	There is no change in energy consumption in US during pandemic
2.	There is no significant change in crude oil prices during pandemic
3.	The increase in usage of renewable energy in recent years doesn’t affect usage of non renewable energy in US.
4.	With development there is increase in per person electricity consumption in both US and around the globe.
5.	With promotion of renewable energy in recent years, there is drop in CO2 emissions.
### Insights from the Global Energy Trends:
- Total of energy consumption all over the world has been constantly rising, but talking about the different regions except Asia Pacific total of energy consumption almost at a constant rate after the year 2000.  
- The World is shifting towards renewable energy, drastic shift can be seen after the year 2010 but from the graph of CO2 emissions it seems that this transition needs to be done at a higher rate. On one hand amount of CO2 emissions increased drastically after 2000 in Asia Pacific but on the other hand amount of emissions seems to be decreasing slightly in the Europe and North America. 
- Moreover it can also seen that major producer and consumer of nuclear energy are North America and Europe and talking about the coal consumption and production then western regions such as North America and Europe have reduced successfully but one the other hand rate of coal consumption and production has increased tremendously in Asia Pacific after year 2000. 
- Talking about natural gas and oil production and consumption Middle east, North America and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) are major producers of oil and natural gas and Asia Pacific and North America are the major consumers of oil and natural gas.
- Although Asia Pacific overtook other regions in production and consumption of renewable energy but the same region is the major contributor in CO2 emissions. 
 The COVID-19 impact: COVID-19 had negatively affected whole energy sector. Growth rate (in year 2020) of production and consumption of almost every is in negative except the  Renewable energy. A decent amount of growth rate i.e., 12 % is observed in production of all over renewable sector moreover CIS region has shown impressive growth rate of 112%. Oil consumption and production seems to be most affected by the COVID-19 with -10% and -7% respectively.

### Results:
1.	There is no change in energy consumption in US during pandemic

Based on the above graph we reject our null hypothesis that there is no change in energy consumption in US during pandemic as we can see that there is steep drop in energy consumption during year 2020-2021 as compared to previous years. As we can see in 2019 the drop between Jan-April was around 18% whereas in 2020 the drop in energy consumption was around 27% for the same period. The percentage drop between this period from 2019 to 2020 is 9%. Similarly comparing energy consumption in year 2018 and 2019 for month of Dec-Jan which was greater than 9.5 quadrillion Btu and it fell to below 9 quadrillion Btu during Dec-Jan 2020 and 2021. Here we can clearly see that there is drop of about 7.5% since the pandemic has come into existence. Though the overall energy consumption pattern recovered(tracked back the same pattern as in 2017-2019) after April 2020  but still there is significant change in amount of energy consumption. Hence, we reject our null hypothesis.

2.	There is no significant change in crude oil prices during pandemic

We reject our null hypothesis that there is no significant change in prices of crude oil during pandemic as from above graph we can see that there is remarkable change in prices of crude oil during the pandemic i.e year 2020 as compared to 2019.

3.	The increase in usage of renewable energy in recent years doesn’t affect usage of non renewable energy.
As from the plot we can see that for the past two decades the consumption of renewable energy is rising constantly but till now it has not created any notable impact on usage of non renewable energy. Hence, the null hypothesis is correct.

4.With automation and increase in usage of technology, accessibility to electronic equipment and gadgets, electrical vehicles there should be increase in per person electricity consumption around the globe. Over the years it is observed that per capita electricity consumption has increased around the globe but interestingly the negative trend is observed in case of US after year 2007. In US the per person electricity consumption was somewhere around 12.9 Million kWh which decreased to 11.6 Million kWh in 2020. There is clearly a drop of 10%. On contrary, there is around 19% growth in per person electricity consumption around the globe from 2007 to 2020. Hence, the hypothesis is true while considering global energy consumption but it is not true in case of US.
